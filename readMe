I built my project using the Gauge framework and Java. I created two spec files, one for the extrinsic SauceDemo task and the second for the API task.
 I adhered to my code conventions and structured it with an OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) approach for readability and clarity.

To run my tests, I enter the following command in the IDE terminal:
mvn clean install -U
